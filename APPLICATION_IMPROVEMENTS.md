## Enhanced Training Types

### Different Learning Modalities
Currently, training is generic. We should support specialized training types:

#### 1. **Reading/Study Sessions**
- **Additional Fields**: Pages read, source (book/article/docs), reading speed
- **Scoring**: Base on comprehension difficulty + retention rate
- **Example**: Reading Laravel documentation, technical books, blog posts

#### 2. **Video Tutorials**
- **Additional Fields**: Video length, playback speed, pause count, notes taken
- **Scoring**: Completion rate × engagement level × difficulty
- **Example**: Laracasts, YouTube tutorials, course videos

#### 3. **Hands-on Coding**
- **Additional Fields**: Lines of code, commits made, bugs fixed, features completed
- **Scoring**: Complexity × quality × time efficiency
- **Example**: Building projects, coding challenges, kata

#### 4. **Problem Solving**
- **Additional Fields**: Problem difficulty, attempts, solution quality, hints used
- **Scoring**: Difficulty multiplier × (1 - hints_used/max_hints) × time bonus
- **Example**: LeetCode, algorithm challenges, debugging

#### 5. **Teaching/Mentoring**
- **Additional Fields**: Students helped, concepts explained, feedback received
- **Scoring**: Teaching multiplier (higher score for teaching)
- **Example**: Code reviews, mentoring sessions, writing tutorials

#### 6. **Project Work**
- **Additional Fields**: Project type, technology stack, features implemented
- **Scoring**: Project complexity × feature completion × code quality
- **Example**: Personal projects, open source contributions

## Improved Scoring System

### Current Issues with Scoring
The current formula `RPE × 1.5 × Duration` treats all activities equally and doesn't account for:
- Learning effectiveness
- Skill difficulty
- Quality of work
- Long-term retention

### Proposed Enhanced Scoring

#### Base Formula
```
Score = (Base_Points × Difficulty_Multiplier × Quality_Factor × Efficiency_Bonus) × Retention_Multiplier
```

#### Components Breakdown

**1. Base Points**
- Reading: 1 point per 10 minutes
- Videos: 1.2 points per 10 minutes (passive learning penalty)
- Coding: 2 points per 10 minutes
- Problem Solving: 3 points per 10 minutes
- Teaching: 4 points per 10 minutes (teaching bonus)

**2. Difficulty Multiplier**
- Beginner: 1.0x
- Intermediate: 1.5x
- Advanced: 2.0x
- Expert: 3.0x

**3. Quality Factor (0.5 - 2.0)**
- Based on self-assessment of understanding
- Validated through quizzes/practical application
- Peer review scores

**4. Efficiency Bonus**
- Faster completion with same quality = bonus
- Slower completion = neutral (learning takes time)

**5. Retention Multiplier**
- Review sessions within 24 hours: 1.2x
- Practice within 1 week: 1.1x
- No follow-up: 0.9x (forgetting curve penalty)
